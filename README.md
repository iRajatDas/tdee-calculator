What is TDEE?
-------------

TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It is an estimate of the total number of calories your body burns in a day, including the calories you burn through physical activity and exercise, as well as the calories your body needs to maintain basic functions like breathing, digestion, and circulation.

Knowing your TDEE can be helpful for various purposes, such as:

*   **Weight Management:** If you want to maintain, lose, or gain weight, understanding your TDEE can help you determine the appropriate calorie intake for your goals.
*   **Meal Planning:** Knowing your daily calorie needs can guide you in creating a balanced meal plan that meets your energy requirements.
*   **Fitness Goals:** TDEE can help you optimize your nutrition and training to support your fitness goals, whether you're looking to build muscle, improve endurance, or enhance overall performance.

### How TDEE is Calculated

We use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), then multiply it by an activity factor to determine your TDEE. This method is widely recognized for its accuracy in estimating daily calorie needs.
